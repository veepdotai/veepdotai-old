Veepdotai is a project to create a complete autonomous web site through voice. A true no code solution.

== Description ==

The Veep project aims at providing thanks to voice recognition a solution to create an autonomous online presence composed of:
* one web site, autonomous
* one LinkedIn profile, autonomous

Autonomous means content is created each day, week, month by the AI for the website, then declined in posts (with carroussel) for LinkedIn, while the LinkedIn audience is augmented through automatic connections each week.

*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.
